          Dear Glub Glub, <br />
          Happy 7th Anniversary! This year was filled with space between us.
          <br />
          We were separated by schools in SoCal, your internship in San Mateo,
          <br />
          and even now with you being sucked in by a whirlpool. But our love<br />
          will always lie heavy in our hearts, and things that have weight
          has<br />
          gravity. One way or another, we always find a way to each other.<br />
          I am always so happy to be with you. I believe you'll find home,
          <br />
          but even if we don't share the same sky or sea, words are<br />
          the only medium that make us connected. I'll always support you <br />
          through and through. I'll be waiting for you on the top! I love
          you!<br />
          Sincerely,<br />
          Meow Meow
